        <p class= "about">My name is Kenneth Matthew Vega, but once you get to know me you'll probably end up calling me Matt. Both of my parents come from the great island of Puerto Rico but I was actually born up north in Hartford, Connecticut. When I was 3 my family wanted a change of pace (and a change of temperature) so we packed our stuff and moved to Charlotte, North Carolina. My family loved it so we have been here ever since! I am a high school graduate and am currently in enrolled in the Software Engineering program at Thinkful. Coding is one of my greatest passions and I love seeing what kind of new and creative things I can implement into my codes and websites. I also love to play chess and solve rubik's cubes in my free time. I hope you enjoy the site and hopefully check out more of my work on some of my other platforms!</p>
